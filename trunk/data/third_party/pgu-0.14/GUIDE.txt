Here's a quick developers guide:

pgu.gui API
===========

1.  Keep it pythonic (in terms of everything!  the more pythonic the better, I suppose)
2.  Keep it pygameic (in terms of events, surfaces)
3.  Keep it Qt-ic (in terms of class names)

4.  Keep it HTML-ic (in terms of class names / API / usability)

General
=======
* Subscribe to the pgu-devel mailing list and talk about ideas and patches.
* Don't break the API without talking on the mailing list.
* Version is still less than 1.0 so some API breaks may still happen
* Freely submit bug and documentation patches.

Coding
======
- Standard python style
- Put #NOTE: by things that need a note
- Put #HACK: by things that are a nasty hack (might mention them in the BUGS.txt)
- Put #FIXME: by things that need to be fixed (also mention them in the BUGS.txt)
