The map editor performs basic scrolling of tiles, with numbered labels, grid, HUD, and a popup menu.

The physics scale is intended to be based on pixels, however all attempts will be made to support sub-pixel math with floating point numbers. Sub-pixel math is compatible with the underlying physics engine, pymunk (chipmunk), and allows fractional speeds, mass, etc. The display code must round and convert physics values to integers where appropriate.

Also, beware that many underlying coordinate "points" are implemented as {{{Vec2d}}}. Attempts will be made to protect them from direct assignment, as clobbering them with a sequence or other object will break some library routines. Keep this in mind when subclassing or choosing to directly access the underlying {{{obj._attributes}}}.

==Initial focus==

Getting organized.

Developing a map editor, which seconds as a practical test of the library and the requirements driver for library features.

Anything marked DONE in the to-do list is not necessarily frozen. It is just considered adequately usable for the purpose it is most recently needed. They will surely evolve as needed.

To do:
  * Basic crap: global state, display, events, timers, physics framework (partially done)
  * Application framework, aka "engine" (DONE)
  * Camera: world-to-screen, screen-to-world, sprite rendering (DONE)
  * Map
    * Basic ground tile serving (DONE)
    * Object classifications: ground tiles, static fixtures
    * Buckets for different ways of looking up game objects
    * Tileset loading and saving
  * Procedural object makers for things that need patterned run-time placement: immovable, mobile, etc.
  * Scrolling with interpolated smoothing (DONE)
  * Menus (DONE)
  * Grid (DONE)
  * HUD (DONE)
  * pymunk editing primitives
    * Line
    * Circle
    * Poly
    * Select
    * Multi-select
    * Move
    * Resize
    * Delete
    * Undo/Redo
  * ~~~Map decorating and tiling

==Working Notes==

===Map Editor===

I am liking Tiled Map Editor and pytmxloader. It is looking like map_editor.py will simply load the tile map, and (initially) just let one add pymunk objects.

Since the Map class is already source agnostic, it may be easy enough to support multiple map editor formats just by adding another toolkit.load_`*` function.

The (Tiled) map layers feature can be used to classify terrain objects, for example "trees go on layer 5". Game makers (i.e. me) may want to do special things with these, like let mobile objects pass under or behind them and temporarily lower the image alpha so the mobile object is not entirely obscured. (Note that this aspect weakens the case for map decorating and tiling in map_editor.py.)
