REQUIREMENTS
============

The Gummworld2 distribution includes all its dependencies except Python and
pygame.

Python is available for many platforms. Pre-built Python bundles are available
at python.org/, third-party implementors, or may be available via your operating
system's package management utilities.

You can get pygame 1.9.1 at pygame.org/, or your operating system's package
management utilities. The latest development builds are available at
thorbrian.com/pygame/builds.php.

Gummworld2 has been tested on Windows XP, Windows 7, and Ubuntu with Python 2.6
and pygame 1.9.1. Others have reported success with Mac OS X and later versions
of Python.


INSTALLATION AND SETUP
======================

Basic instructions.

1. Unpack the ZIP archive anywhere. The base directory created by unzipping the
   archive becomes your project's development tree.
2. Optionally, rename the base directory to reflect your new project.
3. Create your Python game launcher script in the base directory.
4. The game launcher should import the paths module. paths.py is in the root
   directory of the distribution. Alternatively, use inline code similar to that
   in paths.py.
5. Place your game's modules and packages in the gamelib/ directory.
6. Place your game's resources in the data/ subdirectories.
